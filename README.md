# BlackJack for the Browser

This is a repo that has a BlackJack game based on the tutorials in the [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com) full-stack developer path.

I want to continue expanding this game based on new concepts I learn from the course. 

Feel free to share your feedback or ideas for me to work on.
